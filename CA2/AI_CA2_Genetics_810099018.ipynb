    "\n",
    "1) If the polpulation size was large, it didn't help to find the solution faster, otherwise it increases the computational time and memory complexity. If the polpulation size was small, it got harder to find a solution because the chance of finding a solution between a small group is very little and it would be dependent to the first generation and the number of iterations would be significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Increase of the population size does not improve the solution accuracy. Moreover, the computational time is increased significantly and the algorithm become slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The effect of mutation is to generate new chromosomes using random abilities and to prevent getting stuck in local maximums or at least lower probability of it. Also cross over creates new chromosomes that are more likely to be better than their parents and keeps their features.\n",
    "As we see both of them are important. if we don't use mutation, it's possible not to reach goal and get stuck in hundreds of iterations because there is a kind of bias in chromosomes. \n",
    "Without cross over, the only possible thing is to mutate generation. With only mutation it's not possible to find answer, because with using mutation we will find another random solution and it doesn't ensure that it is a better solution and everything will be random. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) there are a lot of ways to make the algorithm faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Early population is important.An early population with low dependency is better.\n",
    "    * In that code, cross over in one position is used, but cross over can be done in more positions.\n",
    "    * In that code, mutation in one position is used, but mutation can be done in more positions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "5) To prevent from getting stuck in a similar population, we can mutate chromosomes in more than one position, cross over more than two chromosomes in more than one position. for example mutation could be done in two random position and cross over chould be done with three chromosomes in three positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) We can consider a maximum iteration or time for the program. If program couldn't find a solution in that considered iterations or time, it would return the nearest solution to desired one. \n",
